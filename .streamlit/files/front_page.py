    st.write('''Forming a diamond deep down in the Earth's mantle takes at least one billion years.
Under high pressure and temperature, carbon-containing fluids dissolve various minerals, and their atoms arrange in an extremely rigid and unyielding way.
Defects and impurities try to permeate them, which determines what color will be adopted, if any, as well as their clarity.
The resulting stones, which may come in many weights and shapes, are later carried to the surface in volcanic eruptions and deposited in igneous rocks.
Those deposits are prospected and mined. Then, the diamonds are sliced, studied, split, bruted, polished, and inspected to meet quality standards.
